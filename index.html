  <body> <mark> Writing helps calm me down, as well as brings a smile on my face when I finish a paragraph and it turns out well. Did you know writing by hand boosts your creativity? I thought that was so interesting, also whenever your writing with your hand, it helps memory as well!! Some people are more disposed to creative writing, but without constant practice, they’ll waste their talent.
      At the same time, people without any “natural talent” can become great writers if they are ready to put in enough effort and time. </body> </mark> </center>
